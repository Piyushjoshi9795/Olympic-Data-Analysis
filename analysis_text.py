The first modern Olympic was held in Athens, Greece in 1896. The ‘modern Olympics’ comprises all the Games from 
Athens 1896 to Tokyo 2020. Baron Pierre de Coubertin presented the idea in 1894.

scenarios are:  Increase in the number of participating nations, Increase in the number of participating Athletes,
Increase/Decrease in the number of events, Increase in the expenditure cost of the event, improvement in the performance
of the particular country, improvement in the performance of a particular player, Increase in women participation,Participation
Ratio of Men to Women, improvement in medication facilities during competition, the effect of pandemic (if any) on the performance 
of the players. Analysis of these scenarios would depict the evolution of the Olympics over the years. This analysis would help in 
future prediction. Olympic data analysis involves the collection, processing, and interpretation of data related to the Olympic Games.
